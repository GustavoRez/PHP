One of the differences between GET and POST, is that
GET shows the result in the URL, while POST just shows
in body.
So it's safer use POST, because it won't show in your
history or cache memory. Makes more difficult to 
attackers stolen your data.
But, GET request is comparatively better than POST (what
don't make sense in my head), so it's more used.
